                        <b>Asset Based Fees</b> - Payable quarterly in arrears.
                        Since the fees we receive are asset-based (i.e. based on
                        the value of your account), we have an incentive to
                        increase your account value which creates a conflict
                        especially for those accounts holding illiquid or
                        hard-to-value assets;

                      <li>
                        <b>Wrap Program Fees</b> - Payable quarterly in arrears.
                        Asset-based fees associated with a wrap fee program
                        generally include most transaction costs and fees to a
                        broker-dealer or bank that has custody of the assets;
                        therefore, the asset-based fee is higher than a typical
                        asset-based advisory fee. Since our firm pays the
                        transaction costs associated with securities
                        transactions in your account, we have an incentive to
                        minimize the trading in your account;
